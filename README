This code is based on the work of Constantin Loizides and Andreas Morsch, as detailed in Phys.Lett. B773 (2017) 408-411 (arXiv:1705.08856).  It was ported to run on top of a default PYTHIA installation by Austin Baty (abaty@rice.edu).  


This implementation is designed to run on top of an already installed version of PYTHIA.  We suggest first installing PYTHIA 8.243 (http://home.thep.lu.se/Pythia/) and confirming that the generator runs before trying to run this code.  Additionally, an installation of ROOT is also required.  The PYTHIA8 static library and the dynamic ROOT libraries will be used when compiling the HG-PYTHIA code.  g++ and make are used to build the code and need to be installed on the system you are building the code with.

Once you have a working version of PYTHIA, go to the base directory of the installation (by default this is in a directory called pythia8243).  Execute the following steps:

git clone https://github.com/abaty/HGPythia.git HG-PYTHIA
cd HG-PYTHIA
make

This should create a directory called 'bin' with an executable if everything runs correctly.  You can execute the code by running:

./bin/HGPYTHIA.exe <nEvents< <RNGSeed> <outputFileName>


Many questions about the code can just be figured out by reading the core part of the event generation, which is only around 200 lines long (~L350 to 550)
